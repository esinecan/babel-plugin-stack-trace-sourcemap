## INSTALL

    npm install babel-plugin-stack-trace-sourcemap --save-dev

or

    yarn add babel-plugin-stack-trace-sourcemap -D

## SYNOPSIS

`$ cat test.js`

```javascript

import foo from 'foo';
import bar from 'bar';

test();
```

`$ babel test.js`

```javascript
'use strict';

var foo = require('foo');
var bar = require('bar');

test();
```

`$ babel --plugins source-map-support test.js`

```javascript
'use strict';

require('source-map-support/register');

var foo = require('foo');
var bar = require('bar');

test();
```

## DESCRIPTION

This is a [Babel 6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel) [plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/advanced/plugins/)
which prepends a statement equivalent to the following to source files:

```javascript
require('source-map-support/register');
```

In conjunction with the [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support)
module, which must be installed separately, this statement hooks into the v8 stack trace API to
translate call sites in the transpiled code back to their corresponding locations in
the original code.

Note: this only works in environments which support the v8 stack trace API (e.g. Node.js and Chrome),
though it is harmless in other environments.

The source-map-support module only needs to be registered in the top-level file of an application,
but it no-ops if it has already been loaded, so there is no harm in registering it in every file.

You may specify a custom import declaration and whether to immediately execute a default export function in your Babel config. This is the effective default configuration:

```javascript
'plugins': [
    ['babel-plugin-stack-trace-sourcemap', {
        'importOverride': ['source-map-support', 'install', '_sourceMapSupport'],
        'execute': true
    }]
]
```

### CAVEATS

Source maps must currently be inline. While the source-map-support module provides a way
to associate a file with an external source map, that is not currently supported by
this plugin.
